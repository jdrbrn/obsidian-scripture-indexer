Index All Files - Indexes all markdown files in the vault

Index This File - Indexes the currently active note

## Settings
Index File Path - What file to write the index to (Index.md by default)

Enable automatic indexing - Toggles if index should be automatically updated when files changes are detected (Enabled by default)
